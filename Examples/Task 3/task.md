# Strings

Strings are a fancy way of saying text - it is important for the computer to be able to tell between text, and numbers.


# Task
Try adding a new variable `name`, and set it to a string by putting it in "quotes"ðŸŽ‡

After you have made the name, create a new `print` statement to print out your name!

# Challenge
Can you print out a name without making a variable to store it first?
